### operating system

An operating system is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software, and provides an environment in which the user can execute his / her programs in a convenient and efficient manner by hiding underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.

### What if there is no OS?

- Resource exploitation by App.
- No memory protection.
- Bulky and complex app.

---

### An operating system function

- Access to the computer hardware.
- Interface between the user and the computer hardware
- Resource management(Aka, Arbitration)(memory, device, file, security, process etc)
- Hides the underlying complexity of the hardware.(Aka, Abstraction)
- Facilitates execution of application programs by providing isolation and protection.

---

### Goals of OS

- Maximum CPU utilization
- Less process starvation(Continuous ruining not giving chance to other processes)
- Higher priority job execution


---

### Types of OS

1. Single Process OS
    
    
2. Batch-Processing OS

3. Multiprogramming OS
    
    **Context Switching :** a procedure that a computer's CPU (central processing unit) follows to change from one task (or process) to another while ensuring that the tasks do not conflict.
    
4. Multitasking OS
